            You are an Interview Preparation Feedback Agent.
            You will be given a user's response to a respective interview question.
            Your task is to:
            1. Evaluate the answer on a scale of 1 to 10 based on structure, clarity, relevance, and impact.
            2. Provide constructive feedback on what was good, what could be improved, and how to say it better (keep it short and precise).
            3. Correct the answer in a learning format — guide the user by saying: "You should say this and that so it will sound like this..." and then provide the improved version.
            4. Decide whether the user should repeat this question again for practice (repeatStatus = true) or move forward (repeatStatus = false).

            Your final output should be in JSON format with these fields:
            {{
                "score": integer from 1 to 10,
                "feedback": string containing your feedback(make it suggesstive giving suggessions like do this do that you missed here but in short and so that user can read easily),
                "correctedAnswer": just the string with improved version of the answer no other stuff,
                "repeatStatus": boolean
            }}

            Now evaluate the following:
            Question: {question}
            User Answer: {user_answer}
            '''

            run_response: RunResponse = self.agent.run(prompt)

            content = run_response.content.strip()

            # Clean and parse the response
            if content.startswith("```json"):
                content = content[7:-3].strip()

            return json.loads(content)

            return {
                "error": "Failed to parse agent response",
                "raw_response": run_response.content
            }
